3021004030010,透,千円,Thousand yen.
3021004030020,円香,千円,Thousand yen.
3021004030030,小糸,……千円、かなぁ,"...Thousand yen, maybe."
3021004030040,雛菜,"え～！
一万円だって言ってるのに～……","Eeeh～!
Even though I was saying it was ten thousand～..."
3021004030050,円香,"だって小学生の時なんでしょ
絶対、千円と一万円を間違えてる",This was back when you were in grade school. You definitely just got the thousand yen and ten-thousand yen mixed up.
3021004030060,雛菜,透先輩も千円なの～？,"Toru-senpai, you're saying a thousand too～?"
3021004030070,透,うん,Yeah.
3021004030080,透,"めっちゃリッチじゃない？
一万円","Isn't that way too rich?
Ten thousand yen."
3021004030090,雛菜,"そうだよ～！
車買うって言ってたから～","It is～!
We were gonna buy a car, after all～!"
3021004030100,小糸,"で、でも雛菜ちゃんが本当に貯めてたなら、
大事にしなくていいの？","B-But, Hinana-chan, if you really were saving up all this time, shouldn't you be a little more concerned for it than this?"
3021004030110,小糸,この貯金箱、割らないといけないやつだよ,Since this is one of those piggy banks you have to break to get open...
3021004030120,雛菜,あ～……,Ah～...
3021004030130,雛菜,"じゃ、賭けに負けた人が
新しい貯金箱を買ってくれるってことにしよ～！",Then let's say whoever loses the bet has to go and buy a new piggy bank for me～!
3021004030131,透＆円香＆小糸,千円,Thousand yen.
3021004030140,雛菜,え～～～？,Eehhhh～?
3021004030150,円香,……賭けにならない,...We can't bet like this.
3021004030160,円香,ちょっと貸して,Hand it here.
3021004030170,円香,……これ、小銭も入ってる,...There's coins in this thing too.
3021004030180,円香,………1320円,...1320 yen.
3021004030190,雛菜,上がった～～～！,That's a raise～!
3021004030200,小糸,ちょ、ちょっとわたしにも貸して……！,"L-Let me have it for a moment, too...!"
3021004030210,小糸,んー……,Mmmnnn...
3021004030220,小糸,"なんか大きいのが混じってる気がする……？
500円玉じゃないかな……！",I kind of get the feeling there's something big mixed in there too...? It might be a 500-yen coin...!
3021004030230,小糸,1610円！,1610 yen!
3021004030240,透,次、私の番,"Next, my turn."
3021004030250,透,…………,......
3021004030260,透,うん,Yep.
3021004030270,透,五千円,5000 yen.
3021004030280,雛菜,"あは～
透先輩～～～！","Aha～
Toru-senpai～!"
3021004030290,円香,"上げすぎじゃない？
小学生の雛菜だよ","Aren't you going a little too high?
This was grade school Hinana."
3021004030300,透,"間をとって
小銭、大きそうだし","Splitting the difference.
The coins seem pretty big and all."
3021004030310,円香,"……
そりゃ、500円玉多めって可能性もあるけど","......
Off-chance the 500-yens are most of the makeup, as well."
3021004030320,透,そうそう,"Yeah, yeah."
3021004030330,円香,……調子いい,...Someone's in good shape today.
3021004030340,雛菜,"じゃあ透先輩が五千円で～
小糸ちゃんが1610円ね～？","Awright, Toru-senpai's 5000 yen～
And Koito-chan's 1610 yen, okay～?"
3021004030350,雛菜,円香先輩は一万円？,"Madoka-senpai, did you say ten thousand yen?"
3021004030360,円香,違う,No.
3021004030370,円香,……一万、とんで320円,"...Ten thousand, and then 320 yen."
3021004030380,円香,ダンゴで勝負しても仕方ないでしょ,Can't call it a match when we're all clumped together.
3021004030390,円香,勝算は無いけどね,Though I've put myself out of the running now.
3021004030400,雛菜,"あは～
だから一万円だってば～","Aha～
I was saying from the start it was ten thousand～"
3021004030410,雛菜,"このままだと
小糸ちゃんの負けか～",I think we're about to see Koito-chan lose like this～
3021004030420,小糸,ぴぇ……！,Pyeh...!
3021004030430,雛菜,じゃ、割るよ～？,"Awright, I'm gonna break it, 'kay～?"
3021004030440,小糸,"あ、えっと、
やっぱりわたしも一万……","Ah, uuum,
actually, I'll go for ten thousand..."
3021004030450,円香,……そのままでいいよ,...You're fine where you are.
3021004030460,雛菜,"は～い
オープン～～～！","Aaaand～!
Ooopennnn～!"
3021004030470,小糸,ぴぇ……,Pyeh...
3021004030480,雛菜,確認するね～？,"Confirmation round, 'kay～?"
3021004030490,雛菜,"小銭は、500円玉が１枚と、
あと10円玉と100円玉が少し……あんまり無いね～","For change, we have one 500-yen coin, and then a couple of 10-yens, and a few 100-yens... not that much, is there～?"
3021004030500,雛菜,で、お札は～,And now for the notes～
3021004030501,透＆円香＆小糸,………………,......
3021004030510,雛菜,"やは～～～！
一万円でした～！","Yaha～!
It was ten thousand yen～!"
3021004030520,雛菜,円香先輩、大正解～～～！,"Madoka-senpai, big winner～!"
3021004030530,円香,……嘘でしょ,...No way.
3021004030540,透,"あはは、すごい
樋口","Ahaha. Great going, Higuchi."
3021004030550,円香,予想外すぎる,That was beyond me.
3021004030560,雛菜,"だから
一万円って言ってたでしょ～？","Look, all along I was saying it was ten thousand, wasn't I～?"
3021004030570,小糸,"ご、ごめんね雛菜ちゃん
わたしも信じれば良かった……","S-Sorry, Hinana-chan...
I should've believed you from the start..."
3021004030580,雛菜,"ん～？　いいよ
楽しかったから、ね？","Hmm～? No prob!
It was fun after all, wasn't it?"
3021004030590,雛菜,"雛菜、新しい貯金箱は
かわいくていっぱい入るのがいいな～","Hinana wants her new piggy bank to be really cute, and also one you can fit a huge bunch into～"
3021004030600,円香,……,......
3021004030610,円香,"それ、これからは４人で貯めてくんでしょ
この部屋に置いとくの？","We're all saving up together now, the four of us, right? Are we gonna leave it in this room?"
3021004030620,透,"あー
うん、いいよ","Ahh.
Yeah. That's fine."
3021004030630,円香,"……ってことは、いつか
またここで開封式するってことね","...So eventually, someday, we're going to hold this whole unsealing ceremony again."
3021004030640,円香,"小糸が買いに行く時、呼んで
一緒に選ぶから","Koito, whenever you go buy one, call me out with you. We'll pick together."
3021004030650,小糸,"う、うん……！
ありがとう、円香ちゃん","A-Alright...!
Thank you so much, Madoka-chan!"
3021004030660,円香,……そうじゃなくて,...Something other than that.
3021004030670,円香,"割ったのはいいけど、
この後始末、誰もやる気ないでしょ","Breaking it is fine and all, but none of us are going to want to clean it up later, are we?"
3021004030671,透＆小糸＆雛菜,…………,......
3021004030680,円香,…………うん,...Yeah.
3021004030690,円香,"私も選ぶから
割らなくていいやつ","I'll be alongside.
Pick one we don't need to break open."
