今日もば～り頑張ったばい！","Fwaah...!
We sure worked hard today!"
3004008010020,咲耶,フフ、お疲れ様,"Hehe, you did well today."
3004008010030,咲耶,"今日の収録も恋鐘の魅力が
出ていたと思うよ",I think that you managed to show your charms in the recording today.
3004008010040,恋鐘,んふふ～、そがん言われると恥ずかしかぁ～！,"Mhehe, you're makin' me blush by sayin' that!"
3004008010050,恋鐘,"そいでも、ちょっと馴れん仕事やったけん
咲耶が一緒で心強かったばい！","I'm still not used to workin' like this,
so it's quite reassurin' that I'm with Sakuya!"
3004008010060,咲耶,"それは光栄だ
…………","That's quite the compliment.
Hmm..."
3004008010070,恋鐘,咲耶？　どげんしたと？,Sakuya? Is something wrong?
3004008010080,咲耶,──いや,Nothing really.
3004008010090,咲耶,"前にふたりでお茶をしたのも、
この近くだったなと思い出してね",I just remembered that we had a few drinks somewhere around here before.
3004008010100,恋鐘,え～？　前に……──？,"Huh? Before, you say...?"
3004008010110,恋鐘,咲耶、咲耶～！,Sakuya! Sakuya～!
3004008010120,恋鐘,"うち、２階がよか～！
あそこ、外の見えるとこ～！","I think it's better on the second floor!
We can see outside from there!"
3004008010130,咲耶,フフ、私はどこでも構わないよ,"Hehe. Sure, I don't mind."
3004008010140,恋鐘,んふふ～、ありがと～！,"Mhehe, thanks～!"
3004008010150,恋鐘,"そいじゃあ、あっち！
行こうかね！","In that case, there!
Let's take that spot!"
3004008010160,咲耶,恋鐘、転ばないようにね？,"Kogane, try not to trip, okay?"
3004008010170,恋鐘,わかっとる～！,I know～!
3004008010180,恋鐘,ここん席ば、とったばい～！,I grabbed these seats for us!
3004008010190,恋鐘,"ふぁ～！　咲耶！　窓の外～！
人の数、すごかね～……","Aahhh! Sakuya! Look out the window!
There's so many people...!"
3004008010200,恋鐘,今日はお祭りかなんかやろか……！,I wonder if there's a festival being held today～?
3004008010210,咲耶,ああ、本当だね,"Oh, there really are."
3004008010220,恋鐘,"信号青になったらみ～んな横断歩道渡っていきよる！
なしてぶつからんとやろ……","When the traffic light turns green, everyone crosses the street at the same time! It's a wonder they don't bump into each other..."
3004008010230,恋鐘,すごかぁ…………,Woah...
3004008010240,恋鐘,"都会はすごかね、咲耶～！
うち、い～っつもそがん思っとると","Isn't the city amazing, Sakuya?
I've always thought so!"
3004008010250,咲耶,"クス、私もさ
こちらに来てから心動かされない日はないよ","Heh, I think so too.
Not a day has passed since I came here that hasn't stirred my heart."
3004008010260,恋鐘,んふふ～！　咲耶もそうやったら間違いなか！,"Mhehe! If it's the same for you, then there's no mistake 'bout it!"
3004008010270,咲耶,"ああ。まるで大海原さ
どんなものが眠っているのか、何に出会えるのか──","Yeah. It's like an ocean. That which lurks beneath, what we might encounter..."
3004008010280,咲耶,"それも広大な世界の中のほんの一部なのだから
驚くしかないよ","And it's just a small part of this vast world, one can't help but be astonished by it all."
3004008010290,恋鐘,"そがん、世界ほどおっきか話になったら
難しかけど──","It's hard if we're talking about something as big as the world, but,"
3004008010300,恋鐘,"こん海ん中に、うちとかアンティーカのこと知っとる人、
きっとだ～れもおらんよね？","In this ocean no one even knows about L'Antica, right?"
3004008010310,咲耶,"そうでないと嬉しいけれど、
フフ、私たちも船出をしたばかりだからね……","I'd be thrilled if that wasn't the case, but, hehe, we've also just set sail..."
3004008010320,恋鐘,"港やったらみ～んな知っとったとに……
そがん思うと、世の中は広かぁ～！","Back in our home ports, everyone knows about us... If I think about it like that, the world is so huge～!"
3004008010330,咲耶,ああ、世界は広い,"Yes, the world is huge."
3004008010340,恋鐘,ばってん──,"But,"
3004008010350,恋鐘,"今見えとるみ～んな、
うちらのファンになってもらうけんね！","We're going to turn all of them out there into our fans, right!?"
3004008010360,咲耶,……！,......!
3004008010370,恋鐘,"んふふ～、そしたら握手会とか
す～っごい列になるとよ","Mhehe, and when that happens, there's going to be really long lines in our handshake events and the like."
3004008010380,恋鐘,"みんなの顔覚えるの大変ばい～！
がんばらんば～",It's going to be hard rememberin' all of their faces! We'll hafta do our best～!
3004008010390,咲耶,"フフ、そうだね
これからが楽しみだよ","Hehe, you're right.
I can't wait for that to happen."
3004008010400,恋鐘,うちも！,Me too!
3004008010410,恋鐘,"そいで歌もダンスもたくさんやって！
CMとかも、い～っぱい出るとよ","Then, we'll be doing a lot of singing and dancing!
We'll even make appearances in stuff like commercials!"
3004008010420,咲耶,"それは素敵だ。街頭の広告にも
可愛らしい恋鐘がたくさん載るんだろうね",That's wonderful. That would mean that everyone will see your lovely face even on the streets.
3004008010430,恋鐘,"うん！　あそこと～、あっちの看板！
あとこの上のおっきかテレビもぜ～んぶ……","Yes! Over there, on that billboard and the big TV above this! All of them!"
3004008010440,恋鐘,ぜ～んぶ、うちらになる！,Everything will be showing us!
3004008010450,咲耶,"恋鐘がそう言うと
実現できそうな気がするよ",Hearing you say that makes me feel that we can turn that into reality.
3004008010460,恋鐘,"あそこの看板も目立つし、あそこもよかね……
咲耶はどこがよか～？","That billboard there stands out and that one's good too... How about you, Sakuya? Which one do you think would be nice～?"
3004008010470,咲耶,"……そうだな、やっぱりこの上の
一番大きいビジョンがいいかな","Well, I guess the one with the biggest screen above us would be nice."
3004008010480,恋鐘,"やっぱりそこがよかよね！
うちも～！","That sure is a nice one!
I think so too～!"
3004008010490,恋鐘,"アンティーカの曲とかが流れとって……
うちとか咲耶とか、霧子、摩美々、結華……","As L'Antica's song is being played,
Me, Sakuya, Kiriko, Mamimi and Yuika..."
3004008010500,恋鐘,"５人の顔がば～ん……！
間違いなか！","Our five faces would have a biiig impact!
No doubt about it!"
3004008010510,咲耶,"ああ、その時は一緒に見に来たいものだね
……フフ、５人で来たら大騒ぎになるかな","Yes, I'd like us to go and see it when that time comes... Heh, we'd might cause quite an uproar should all five of us come."
3004008010520,恋鐘,"うん！　はよ見たか～！
どがん感じになるとやろか～……","Yeah! I so want to see it right away!
I wonder what it'd be like～?"
3004008010530,咲耶,"きっと、恋鐘の可愛らしさが溢れるような……
そんな画面になるはずさ",I'm sure that the view will be brimming with your cuteness.
3004008010540,恋鐘,"え～～っ！
うちだけじゃお話にならんよ！",Eh～～? Don't make this sound like it's only about me!
3004008010550,恋鐘,咲耶とみんなとでば～りばりばい～！,We're all going to make it big～!
