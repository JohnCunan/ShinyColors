3001005010020,真乃,"ほわぁ……
ひんやり、気持ちいい……","Howaa...
It's nice and chilly..."
3001005010030,灯織,"おはよう、真乃
今日は外、暑いよね","Morning, Mano.
It's quite hot outside today, isn't it?"
3001005010040,真乃,"あ、灯織ちゃん、おはよう
うん、日差しが強くてたくさん汗かいちゃった","Ah, Hiori-chan! Morning!
Yep, the sunlight is really strong...
I ended up sweating a lot."
3001005010050,真乃,"……まだ打ち合わせまで時間あるけど
灯織ちゃん早いね","...There's still a some time before our meeting...
You're quite early, Hiori-chan."
3001005010060,灯織,"プロデューサーから仕事が決まったって
聞いたから、ちょっと気になって","Once I heard from Producer that we had a job,
I ended up being a little curious..."
3001005010070,真乃,"そっか
私たち３人で雑誌の撮影のお仕事、だったよね","I see.
Us 3 will have a photo shoot for a magazine, right?"
3001005010080,真乃,"（お仕事がもらえたことも嬉しいけど……
３人で一緒にいられるのが、１番嬉しいな）","(Of course, I'm glad we were able to land a job...
But I'm most happy for the fact that we will
be doing it together～)"
3001005010090,真乃,ふふ……今年は楽しい夏になりそう,"Fufu...
This summer seems like it'll be fun."
3001005010100,灯織,"そうだね
……真乃たちと一緒なら、きっといい思い出が作れる","Yeah.
...As long as we're all together, we're sure to make
wonderful memories."
3001005010110,真乃,"ほわ……そ、そうだねっ
一緒の思い出作りたいねっ","Howa... I-I agree!
I'd love to do that together!"
3001005010120,灯織,うん,Yeah.
3001005010130,灯織,……去年の私だったら、想像もしてなかったんだろうな,"...The person I was last year would've never
imagined that I'd be doing something like this now..."
3001005010140,灯織,"…………
真乃は去年の夏、どんなことしてたの？","............
What did you do for last year's summer, Mano?"
3001005010150,真乃,"去年の夏……？
え、えっと…………","Last year's summer...?
Ah, hmm..."
3001005010160,真乃,"ピーちゃんと一緒に公園に行ったり
鳥さんを見に山までハイキングに行ったりしたよ","I visited the park to meet with Pii-chan,
went hiking in the mountains to go birdwatching...
Things like that."
3001005010170,真乃,"……あ、あれ？
あんまりいつもと変わらないかな？","...H-Huh? Now that I think about it,
it's not very different from what I normally do..."
3001005010180,灯織,ふふ、真乃らしくて、いいと思う,"Fufu, I think that's fine.
It's very Mano-like."
3001005010190,真乃,"そうかな？　あっ、でもね
夏休みだから、いつもより遠くの山まで行ってきたんだっ","Is that so? Ah, though...
Since it was summer break, I went to a much
further mountain than I usually do."
3001005010200,真乃,"いつもと違うところで色んな鳥さんにも会えて……
澄んだ空気の中にいたら、ほわぁって気持ちよかったよ","And in that new place, I met all sorts of birds...
The air was crystal clean, and the whole
experience was just reeally wonderful～"
3001005010210,灯織,"ふふ、リラックスできて良さそう……
きっと景色も綺麗だったんだろうね","Fufu, it sounds like it was very relaxing...
The view must've been beautiful too."
3001005010220,真乃,"うんっ
夏に咲くお花も見れてとっても楽しかったな","Yep!
Viewing the summer flowers in bloom was fun, too."
3001005010230,真乃,あっ、でも去年は……,"Ah, speaking of last year's summer..."
3001005010240,灯織,"？
何かあったの？","?
Did something else happen?"
3001005010250,真乃,"私、うっかり日焼け止めを塗り忘れちゃってね
お風呂に入るたび痛くて……すっごく大変だったんだ","I got a sunburn one time, because I completely
forgot to put on sunscreen. It was painful every
time I entered the bath... It was not very fun."
3001005010260,真乃,あの時は、ヒリヒリして本当に痛かったなぁ,The stinging was really bad at the time...
3001005010270,灯織,"……油断しちゃダメだよ、真乃
日焼けは火傷の一種なんだから、ちゃんと対策しなきゃ","...You can't be lax about that, Mano.
Sunburns are serious, so you should always
take the proper measures to prevent them."
3001005010280,灯織,真乃は肌が綺麗なんだし、特に気をつけないと……,"Your skin is so clean and pretty too,
so you should pay extra attention..."
3001005010290,真乃,ほ、ほわぁ……そ、そうだよね,H-Howa... Y-You're right...
3001005010300,灯織,"──そうだ、さっき読んでた雑誌に
日焼け止め特集があったの","──Speaking of which, that one magazine
had a special section just for sunscreen."
3001005010310,灯織,"一緒に見てみよう
それで今年は、絶対に忘れないようにしなきゃ。ね？","Let's look at it together.
That way, you'll surely not forget this year. Okay?"
3001005010320,真乃,う、うん,O-Okay!
3001005010330,真乃,"（灯織ちゃん……
私のこと、すごく真剣に心配してくれたんだな……）",(Hiori-chan... She's taking my safety so seriously...)
3001005010340,真乃,……ふふ,...Fufu.
3001005010350,灯織,？　どうかした？,? What's the matter?
3001005010360,真乃,"ううん、なんでもないよ
……日焼け止めの特集って、どれかな？","Uh-uh, it's nothing.
...Which page is the sunscreen section?"
3001005010370,灯織,"ほら、ちょうど──
このページ……","Oh, actually──
It's right on this page..."
3001005010380,真乃,"ほんとだ。でも、日焼け止めって
いっぱい種類があるね……う～ん……","It is. But there's so many kinds to choose from...
Hmm..."
3001005010390,灯織,"１回お店に行って
自分の肌に合うか試したほうがいいのかも……","It might be better to visit the store and see
which ones match your skin the best..."
3001005010400,真乃,そうだね、そうしてみようかな──,"That makes sense, maybe I will do that～"
3001005010410,真乃,あっ,Ah...
3001005010420,真乃,……この水着、とっても可愛い……,...This swimsuit is really cute...
3001005010430,灯織,ん？　どれ？,Hm? Which one?
3001005010440,灯織,"……うん、そうだね
真乃にも似合いそう","...Yeah, it is.
It looks like it'd match you, Mano."
3001005010450,真乃,"ほわ、
そ、そうかな……？","Howa...
R-Really...?"
3001005010460,真乃,"あ、こっちの水着は
灯織ちゃんに似合いそうだよ","Oh, and this swimsuit here looks like it'd match
you, Hiori."
3001005010470,灯織,……良いね。私もこういうの好きかな,"...It looks nice.
This swimsuit does fits my tastes."
3001005010480,真乃,"ふふっ
こうして雑誌を見てると、新しいのが欲しくなっちゃうね","Fufu. You end up wanting to buy more things
when you read a magazine like this."
3001005010490,灯織,"ふふ、そうだね……
真乃は泳ぐの、好き？","Fufu, indeed...
Do you like swimming, Mano?"
3001005010500,真乃,"うん。身体の力を抜いて
ふわふわ浮いてるの、楽しいから","Yep. It's fun to lay back, relax,
and just float on the water..."
3001005010510,灯織,"うーん……？
それは、泳いでるっていうか……","Hmm...?
I wouldn't really call that swimming..."
3001005010520,真乃,"流れるプールとかも興味あるんだけど
今まで行く機会があんまりなくて……","I'd love to try going to a lazy river, but...
I haven't had the chance to go to one yet..."
3001005010530,灯織,そっか……,I see...
3001005010540,灯織,……っ,......
3001005010550,灯織,……ダメ。黙ってたら何も変わらないでしょ……！,"...No. If you stay quiet now, nothing will happen...!"
3001005010560,真乃,灯織ちゃん？,Hiori-chan?
3001005010570,灯織,あ、あの……じゃあ……,U-Umm... In that case...
3001005010580,灯織,今度、３人で──！,"Next time, all 3 of us can──!"
3001005010590,めぐる,おはようございまーす！,Good morning!
3001005010600,めぐる,"あっ、真乃！　灯織！
聞いて聞いてーっ！","Ah, Mano! Hiori!
