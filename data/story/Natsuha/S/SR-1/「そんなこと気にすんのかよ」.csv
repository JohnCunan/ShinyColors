3013006010010,夏葉,"雲行きが怪しいわね……
レッスン場に着くまでに降らないといいけれど","I don't like the look of those clouds...
I sure hope it doesn't rain until we reach the studio."
3013006010020,樹里,"まー、雨降るかは微妙らしいし
なんとかなるんじゃねーか","Well, I don't think the rain should be that bad.
We'll probably be fine."
3013006010030,夏葉,こんな時に限って傘を忘れてくるなんて……,Of all the times to forget my umbrella...
3013006010040,樹里,傘ならアタシが持ってきてるし、大丈夫だろ,"Oh don't worry, I brought my umbrella along today."
3013006010050,夏葉,"私も用意はしてたんだけど……
今日はたまたま……","I'm usually prepared for this sort of thing... 
It just so happened that today I wasn't able to..."
3013006010060,樹里,"ふーん……
ま、そんな時もあるよな","Hmmm...
Well, it happens to the best of us."
3013006010070,夏葉,"いえ、帰ったらすぐに鞄に入れるわ
失敗は繰り返さな……","No, afterwards, I will put the umbrella in my bag\nimmediately. I will make sure a mistake like this\nnever happens again."
3013006010080,夏葉,あっ！,Ah!
3013006010090,樹里,"……うわっ！
降ってきたな……","...Wha! 
It's starting to rain."
3013006010100,樹里,"──ほら、傘
入れよ","C'mon. Umbrella.
Get under here."
3013006010110,夏葉,でも……,But...
3013006010120,樹里,"？
早く入らないと濡れんぞ","Hm?
If you don't get under here soon, you're gonna get soaked. "
3013006010130,夏葉,その傘、ふたりで入るには小さすぎるわ,I think this umbrella is too small for the two of us.
3013006010140,樹里,そーか……？,Really...?
3013006010150,夏葉,"……私はいいわ
樹里がひとりで使いなさい","Don't worry about me. 
You can use the umbrella for yourself."
3013006010160,樹里,"はぁ？　なんでだよ
濡れるよりはふたりで入った方がいーだろ","Huhhh? What are you even saying? 
It's better for both of us to be under here than to get wet, right?"
3013006010170,夏葉,"ダメよ
樹里が風邪をひいたら大変じゃない","That won't do. 
It would be bad if you caught a cold. "
3013006010180,樹里,……そんなこと気にすんのかよ,...You don't need to worry about that.
3013006010190,夏葉,"じゃあタクシーを呼びましょう
それならふたりとも濡れないで済むわ！","In that case, I'll hail us a taxi. 
Neither one of us would have to get wet that way!"
3013006010200,樹里,……いや、確かに濡れなくて済むけどさ……,"Well, that'd definitely ensure that we stay dry, but..."
3013006010210,樹里,"……──あ
あそこにバス停があるじゃねーか","...Ah. 
Is that a bus stop over there?"
3013006010220,樹里,ちょっと時刻表、見に行こうぜ,Let's go check out the time table.
3013006010230,夏葉,タクシーを呼んだ方が早いと思うけど……,I still think that it would be faster if we took a taxi.
3013006010240,樹里,えーっと……,Let's see...
3013006010250,夏葉,どう？,Well?
3013006010260,樹里,"おー、結構すぐ来るみたいだ
これならタクシーの必要はねーな","Oh, it seems that a bus will arrive soon. 
We won't need a taxi then. "
3013006010270,夏葉,"ふぅん……
バスも案外便利なのね","Hmmm.
Buses are unexpectedly convenient. "
3013006010280,樹里,うわ、かなり降ってきたな……,"Wow, it's really pouring huh..."
3013006010290,夏葉,"そうね……
樹里、濡れてない？","For sure... 
Are you still dry, Juri?"
3013006010300,樹里,ああ、動かなきゃ大丈夫だよ,"Yeah. As long as I don't move under here, I'm fine."
3013006010310,夏葉,でも、ほら肩のあたりが濡れているわ,"But, look, your shoulder is still getting wet."
3013006010320,夏葉,"もう少し詰めましょう……
ほら、樹里も","Here, let's get a bit closer together... 
C'mon Juri."
3013006010330,樹里,あ、ああ,"Oh, yeah."
3013006010340,夏葉,……しばらく止まないのかしら,It doesn't seem that the rain will let up any time soon.
3013006010350,樹里,そうだな……,Seems so...
3013006010360,夏葉,あ、そうだ……,Oh yeah...
3013006010370,樹里,"ん？
……なんだそれ","Hm? 
What's that?"
3013006010380,夏葉,"ハンカチよ
……ほら、これで拭きなさい","A handkerchief. 
You can use it to dry yourself off."
3013006010390,樹里,"いや、それくらい見りゃわかるよ
…………あー、これくらい大丈夫だって","Well, I know that at least. 
C'mon, I already said that this is nothing."
3013006010400,夏葉,"ダメよ
体が冷えちゃうわ。ちょっとじっとしてなさい……","That's no good. 
Your body is already getting cold. Just stay still for a bit..."
3013006010410,樹里,だ、だから、いいって！,"I already told you, I'm fine!"
3013006010420,樹里,"……えっと
拭くにしても、自分でやるから","...Ah, fine. 
At least let me wipe it myself. "
3013006010430,夏葉,それだとちゃんと拭けないでしょう？,"Do you really think you can wipe it properly yourself? "
3013006010440,樹里,"や、そうかもしれねーけど……
って、おいそこ……","I mean, that's probably true but... 
Hey! What are you?"
3013006010450,樹里,"あはは！
やめ、くすぐったい……！","Ahaha! 
Stop that! That tickles! "
3013006010460,夏葉,"もうちょっと……
うん、これで大丈夫ね","Just a bit longer...
Alright, you should be good now."
3013006010470,樹里,"おー
…………わりーな……","Ohー
Sorry about that..."
3013006010480,夏葉,"いいえ、私だって傘に入れてもらってるもの
お互い様よ","No worries. I forgot to bring by umbrella in the first place. 
We're just helping each other."
3013006010490,樹里,"う……、そーか
それならいいけど……","Hm, I see. 
Well, if you're fine with it then..."
3013006010500,夏葉,"ふふ……バス、もうすぐかしらね
楽しみになってきたわ","Fufu... The bus is probably going to be here soon. 
This is going to be pretty fun.  "
3013006010510,樹里,"楽しみ、って……
……もしかして、乗ったことないのか！？","Fun...?
Wait, are you saying that you've never rode on a bus before!?"
3013006010520,夏葉,"ほとんどないわ
出かけるなら、車を用意すればいいでしょ？","Yes, never. 
If you're heading out, don't you usually take a car?"
3013006010530,樹里,"……あー……
夏葉ならそうなるか……","Ahhh... 
So that's how you did things, huh Natsuha?"
3013006010540,夏葉,あ！　来たわ！,"Oh, it's here!"
3013006010550,樹里,ん？,Hm?
3013006010560,樹里,"……って、あれはちげーよ
別路線のバスだ","That's the wrong bus. 
Our bus takes another route."
3013006010570,夏葉,"あら、そうなの……？
結構複雑なのね","Oh, is that how it is? 
Buses are pretty difficult. "
3013006010580,樹里,……お、今度こそ来たぞ,"...Oh, this one's ours. "
3013006010590,樹里,──あ,Oh yeah.
3013006010600,夏葉,どうしたの？,What's wrong?
3013006010610,樹里,"夏葉、
ICカードは持ってるよな？","Natsuha.
Do you have an IC card?"
3013006010620,夏葉,"……持ってないわ
でも、クレジットカードならあるわよ？","I do not. 
But I do have my credit card with me."
3013006010630,樹里,"…………
マジかよ……","...... 
Seriously...?"
3013006010640,夏葉,それがないと、乗れないの？,I can't ride the bus if I don't have one?
3013006010650,樹里,"いや、まー……
大丈夫だけどさ……","Well, I mean... 
It's fine but..."
3013006010660,夏葉,"そう、よかった
ちゃんと乗れるのね……","Well that's good to hear. 
Then I can get on, right?"
3013006010670,夏葉,──……あら,...Oh.
3013006010680,夏葉,"樹里、見て
向こうの空はもう明るいわ","Look Juri.
The sky's already clearing up in front of us."
3013006010690,樹里,お、ほんとだ……,"Oh, you're right..."
3013006010700,夏葉,"ふふ……きっと、
もうすぐここも晴れるわね","Fufu... 
Very soon, the sky will clear up."
