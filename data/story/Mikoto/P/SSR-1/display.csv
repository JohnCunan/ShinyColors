重くなるかもしれないけど","......
It's quite a list. The basket might get a little heavy."
2025004020060,美琴,それでも……いいの？,You sure you want to carry it...?
0,プロデューサー,"おう
それなら、なおさら持つよ！",Sure as can be. I'll take that as a challenge!
2025004020070,美琴,"本当？
じゃあ、お願いしようかな","Really?
Then it's all yours, I suppose."
0,プロデューサー,ああ、任せとけ！,Leave it to me!
2025004020080,美琴,…………,......

やっぱり私が持つ？","If you've changed your mind about the basket, just say the word."
0,プロデューサー,"いや、大丈夫だよ
……そうじゃなくてさ","Nah, I can handle it.
That's not the issue..."
0,プロデューサー,"こんなに色々買うなら通販とかで
自宅に届けてもらったほうが楽じゃないかと思って","I was just thinking...
If you're buying this much, wouldn't it be easier to order online and have it delivered to your home?"
2025004020180,美琴,………………,......
2025004020190,美琴,"前に一度そうしてみたけど
あっという間に宅配ボックスがいっぱいになって","I tried that before, but my delivery locker would always end up full before I knew it."
2025004020200,美琴,"私は練習で、家に居る方が少ないから
全然受け取れなくて、やめたの","I spend most of my time training, so I'm hardly ever home to accept deliveries. So I gave up on that."
0,プロデューサー,……そうだったのか,......Ah. Figures.
0,プロデューサー,"それなら今度から、
事務所で受け取っても構わないけど","If you'd like, you could have your stuff delivered to the office instead."
2025004020210,美琴,"……え、そうなの？
うーん……そっか……","Huh... you don't mind that kind of thing?
Well... hmm..."
2025004020220,美琴,"それはありがたいけど……
でも、いいの","I appreciate it...
But I think I'll pass up on that."
2025004020230,美琴,"こうやってお店で
一つ一つを探して、手に取りたいから","I like browsing the shelves like this, finding things one by one and being able to hold them in my hands."
2025004020240,美琴,"この雑誌のグラビアの子も、
このドラマに出ている女優の子も","You see...
The model on the cover of this magazine...
The actress starring in this drama series..."
2025004020250,美琴,"みんな昔、一緒にアイドルを目指していて……
ほとんどの子が、違う道に進んでいったけど","I know all of these girls from back when we were all training to become idols together. Most of them ended up taking a different path, though."
2025004020260,美琴,"……こうやって、今の活動が形になって
並んでいる所を見ると──……","Seeing the fruits of their labor on display here, it's...
......"
2025004020270,美琴,………………,......
0,プロデューサー,……そうか、なるほどな,"Right...
So that's how it is."
0,プロデューサー,"雑誌、随分色々なジャンルの物を入れてるなとは
思ったけど……そういうことか",I was beginning to wonder how you could be into so many different genres of magazines... but it all adds up now.

0,プロデューサー,"雑誌もCDも、なんでもすぐ
データで手に入る時代だけどさ","You know, it's easier than ever to buy magazines or CDs digitally these days."
0,プロデューサー,"こうやって店に来たり、
実際に物を手に取ることが美琴の…………","But coming to a physical store and picking up the real thing... 
I think it'll be a good source of motivation for you."
0,プロデューサー,"いや、俺も
良い刺激になるから","And for me as well, actually."
