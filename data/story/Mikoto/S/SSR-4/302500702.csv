3025007020010,にちか,つ、疲れたー……,T-this is tiring...
3025007020020,美琴,そうだね,It's only natural.
3025007020030,美琴,"覚えることも多いし
今日の練習は結構ハードかもしれない","There's a lot to memorize.
Today's practice may be quite intense."
3025007020040,にちか,"す、すみません……！
弱音吐くみたいな……","I-I'm so sorry...!
I'm not complaining, or anything..."
3025007020050,にちか,"ちょっと、ハードめだったって思っちゃったんですけど
全然、全然やるので……","I was only thinking to myself that it's a bit intense.
Even if it is, I'm definitely going to get it right..."
3025007020060,美琴,……うん,...Mm.
3025007020070,美琴,"だけど、今日の分は今日
しっかりクリアしないと","Even if it's intense, we need to finish perfecting
today's choreography before the day is over."
3025007020080,美琴,いつまで経っても、先に進めない,"If we keep dawdling, we won't be able to move onto
perfecting the next part."
3025007020090,にちか,はいっ……,Yes...
3025007020100,美琴,"休憩したら、さっきのところ
もう一回やろう","Let's take a break, and then run through that again."
3025007020110,美琴,できるまで,Until we can get it perfect.
3025007020120,にちか,はい……！,Yes...!
3025007020130,美琴,──……はぁ,──...Mm.
3025007020140,にちか,────あっ,────Oh!
3025007020150,美琴,……？,......?
3025007020160,にちか,……あった,...Here it is.
3025007020170,美琴,…………チョコレート？,...Is that chocolate?
3025007020180,にちか,"はい
来る前にコンビニ寄ったので","Yes!
I picked it up at the convenience store earlier."
3025007020190,にちか,"練習して疲れたら
甘いもの欲しくなるかなーって思って……","I thought it'd be smart to have something sweet on
hand in case I got worn out during practice..."
3025007020200,美琴,"……そう
準備がいいね","...I see.
You're well-prepared."
3025007020210,にちか,"美琴さんも
もしよかったら──……","Would you like some chocolate too, Mikoto-san──"
3025007020220,美琴,"ううん
私はいいや","No, thank you.
I'm alright."
3025007020230,にちか,"あ……そうですよね
すみません！","Oh... right, of course.
Pardon me!"
3025007020240,美琴,"いいの
気にしないで食べて","It's alright.
Don't mind me. Go on and eat."
3025007020250,にちか,"は、はい……
すみません、目の前で","R-right...
I'm sorry for eating right in front of you."
3025007020260,にちか,いただきます……！,Here I go...!
3025007020270,美琴,──……,──......
3025007020280,美琴,あ…………,Oh......
3025007020290,美琴,そういえば、食べた？,"That reminds me, did you eat it?"
3025007020300,にちか,えっ？,Eh?
3025007020310,美琴,"前に渡した、チョコ
バレンタインの時の","The chocolate I gave you a while back.
For Valentine's Day."
3025007020320,にちか,…………！,......!
3025007020330,美琴,……？,......?
3025007020340,にちか,"い、いえ……その
実は、まだで……","O-oh... ummm.
The truth is, I haven't yet...	"
3025007020350,にちか,すみません……！,I apologize...!
3025007020360,美琴,そうなんだ,I see.
3025007020370,にちか,"あの、なんていうか……
……めちゃめちゃもったいなくって……","It just, how do I put it...
...I really really don't want to waste it..."
3025007020380,にちか,"しっかり味わって食べれる日に食べようって思って……
そしたら、あんまりコンディションいい日がなくって……","I want to make sure I eat it on a day where I can
really savor it... And I haven't had any days like that
recently..."
3025007020390,美琴,……普通に食べたらいいと思うけど,"...I don't think there's anything wrong with eating it
like you would any other chocolate."
3025007020400,美琴,"それこそ、練習の合間に
食べてもいいし","You could bring it along and eat it during the breaks
in our practice like you are now."
3025007020410,にちか,"だ、だって
一粒400円くらいしたじゃないですか……！？","B-but, I mean!
That chocolate cost ¥400 a piece, right...!?"
3025007020420,美琴,"……？
うん","......?
Mm."
3025007020430,にちか,それに、美琴さんから頂いたものだから……その,"And also, it was a gift you gave me, so...
Ummm."
3025007020440,美琴,"……まあ
いつ食べてくれてもいいんだけど","...Well, feel free to eat it whenever you'd like."
3025007020450,美琴,賞味期限切れる前には、よかったら食べて,"Just try to eat it before it expires, if you can."
3025007020460,にちか,"は、はい……！
もちろんです……！","Y-yes...!
Of course...!"
3025007020470,美琴,"結構日持ちすると思うし
まだ全然大丈夫だとは思うけど","I think it should keep for a good while longer.
So you should still have plenty of time left."
3025007020480,美琴,……多分,...Most likely.
3025007020490,美琴,──……はぁ,──...Whew.
3025007020500,美琴,"──よし
じゃあ、そろそろ再開しようか","──Alright.
It's about time to get back."
