It's impressive that you're already preparing..."
3025007010260,にちか,"そういうのは、
ちゃんと考えておかないとダメですよね……","It's important to start thinking about these things
far in advance..."
3025007010270,美琴,"仕事関係の人とか
なかなか会えない人も多いから","I have a lot of people I know through work, and a lot
of acquaintances I don't see very often as well..."
3025007010280,美琴,"いつでも渡せるように
少し早めに準備したほうがいいかなって","I try to prepare far in advance so I'll be ready to give

結構日持ちするでしょ？","Chocolate keeps for a long time, doesn't it?"
3025007010300,にちか,"そ、そうですね……！
多分……！","T-that's true...!
I think...!"
3025007010310,美琴,あとは美味しければいいな,"And of course, I that hope it tastes good as well."
3025007010320,美琴,"あのお店、有名らしいから
不味いってことは無いと思うけど","That shop appears to be very famous, so I doubt
that their chocolate would taste bad."

お、美味しくなかったらパンチですよね……！","......!
If it tastes bad then that shop is in for a bonking...!"
3025007010340,にちか,だって一粒400円とかでしたよ……！？,"I mean, that chocolate cost like ¥400 apiece, right...!?"
3025007010350,美琴,"え？　うん

Something like that."
3025007010360,にちか,"コンビニなら
板チョコ４枚は買えちゃいますよ……！","You can buy four bars of chocolate for that much at
the convenience store...!"

５枚買えますし……！","And at the drugstore in my neighborhood, ¥400 can
buy you five bars...! "
3025007010380,美琴,……そうなんだ,...I see.
3025007010390,にちか,そうです……！,It's true...!
3025007010400,にちか,"大体、美琴さんにチョコレートもらって
美味しくないわけないですから！","In any case, there's no way that chocolate that was
a gift from you wouldn't be delicious, Mikoto-san!"

I shouldn't, I really shouldn't...!!"
3025007010470,にちか,これ、美琴さんがどなたかに渡すやつですよね！？,"I mean, isn't this the chocolate you're going to give
out to someone!?"
3025007010480,美琴,……？,......?
3025007010490,美琴,うん、だからこれ,"Mm, that's why I'm giving it to you.        "
