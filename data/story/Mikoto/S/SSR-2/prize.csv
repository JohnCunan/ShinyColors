3025004020070,にちか,あのニュースだ……,It's that TV show...
3025004020080,美琴,え？,Huh?
3025004020090,にちか,"……あ、えっと
少し前に出たお昼の番組で","...Um, you know.
That afternoon talk show we were on a bit ago."
3025004020100,にちか,"ニュースにコメント言うやつ、あったじゃないですか
ほんとかどうか検証する、みたいな","The one where we had to comment on news stories,
remember? And then say whether we thought they
were true or not. "
3025004020110,美琴,"あ……うん
……あの番組か","Oh... Mm.
...Right, that show."
0000000000000,番組アナウンサー,"『──人気アスリート、ドーピングで検挙

3025004020130,にちか,"ネットの噂から広がって、
問題になったやつでしたよね","Rumors about it were being spread on the internet,
and it had become this big topic of discussion. "

0000000000000,番組アナウンサー,"──ということなんですけれども、
スポーツ界のドーピングの噂、どう思われますか？","──is what has been reported.
What do you think of these rumors of doping in the
realm of sports?"
3025004020170,美琴,……そうですね,...Let me see.
3025004020180,美琴,"これが嘘の噂だとすれば、
こんなに卑劣なことはないと思います","If these rumors are false, then I think it's no topic
for discussion."
0000000000000,番組MC,"一気にイメージがついちゃうもんね
でもほんとだったら、ドーピングは許せないなぁ","Yeah, it won't be long before these rumors tarnish
that athlete's reputation. However, if they are true,
doping can't go unpunished."

3025004020200,美琴,"どんな事情があってもスポーツでルールに違反すれば、
それは負けになると思います","I think that no matter what the circumstances are,
disobeying the rules in sports means those wins
must all be considered losses."

3025004020230,にちか,"結局違ってた、って話になるって
思ってたんですよね","It's kinda hard to believe, in the end.
I really didn't think they would do that..."
3025004020240,にちか,"別にファンじゃないですけど、なんか……
…………──────","It's not like I was a real big fan of them or anything,
but it's...
...──────"
3025004020250,美琴,……もう、そうするしかなかったのかも,...I wonder if they felt they had no choice.

3025004020270,美琴,"パフォーマーは
自分の限界を超えるようなシーンを夢見るものだから","Performers are always dreaming of being able to
surpass their limits."
3025004020280,美琴,真面目な人なら、なおさら,"Even more so, if you're someone dedicated. "
3025004020290,美琴,"いろんな事情があって、
追い詰められたりすることもあるのかも","Certain circumstances may make one feel as if they
have no other options left."
3025004020300,にちか,………………,............
3025004020310,にちか,……はい,...Yes.
3025004020320,美琴,"わからないけどね
それに、だからって許されることでもない","Not that I have any idea, myself.
And even then, it's still no excuse."
3025004020330,美琴,"たったひとつの嘘が
それまでの努力も成果も、全てを嘘にしてしまう","A single falsehood turns all of the effort one
had put in, and results one had achieved up to that
point, into falsehoods as well. "
3025004020340,美琴,……本当だったことも、全部,"...Even the things that were true at the time,
would now be falsehoods."
0000000000000,タクシー運転手,"──あのー……

I'm so sorry! I'll fasten it now...!"
0000000000000,タクシー運転手,"すみませんねー
最近は後部座席の方も絶対着用って厳しくって","I'm sorry about that.
Recently, the higher ups have gotten real strict
about making sure we get passengers to buckle up."
0000000000000,タクシー運転手,"でも事故とかあったら大変だし
お客さんの為でもあるから","But it is important in case there's ever an accident.
Really, the seatbelts are there for your own good."
3025004020370,にちか,"は、はい……！
