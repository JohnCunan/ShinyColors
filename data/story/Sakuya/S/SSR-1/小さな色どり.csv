3006004020010,恋鐘,おっはよー！,Mornin'!
3006004020020,咲耶,"おはよう
今日はお招きありがとう","Morning.
Thanks for inviting us today."
3006004020030,摩美々,お邪魔しまぁす,Excuse us～
3006004020040,恋鐘,"あれー？
結華と霧子は一緒じゃなかと？","Huh?
Neither Yuika or Kiriko are here?"
3006004020050,摩美々,ふたりそろって寝坊ですかねー？,Maybe they decided to oversleep together～?
3006004020060,咲耶,まあ、ゆっくり待とうじゃないか,"Well, we're not in a rush anyways."
3006004020070,恋鐘,"そうやね！　はぁー、ばり楽しみたい！
うちの爪ば、どげん風になるんやろ～","You're right! Ahh, I'm super excited!
I wonder how my nails will turn out～"
3006004020080,摩美々,でー、どんな感じとかリクエストあるー？,"Well, how do you want them to turn out～?"
3006004020090,恋鐘,"もちろん、うちに似合うばりキラキラのやつたい！
ぴかーっと光るやつとかなかと！？","Of course, somethin' super sparkly to match me!
Something that goes ""shiiing""!"
3006004020100,摩美々,イルミネーションとか付けるのー？,"So you want lights on your nails, maybe～?"
3006004020110,恋鐘,"そ、それたい！
摩美々のより、もっとピッカピカになりたかー！","P-Perfect!
Then it'd be tons flashier than your nails, Mamimi!"
3006004020120,摩美々,えー、ジョーダンなんだケド……,Huuh? I was joking though...?
3006004020130,咲耶,"フフ
どんなネイルになるのか、楽しみだな","Haha. 
I'm looking forward to how it'll turn out."
3006004020140,咲耶,"おっと、結華から連絡が来たよ
……どうやら急用で遅れるらしい","Ah, I got a message from Yuika.
...It seems like something urgent turned up, so
she'll be late."
3006004020150,恋鐘,"霧子からも来とるばい
結華と一緒におるみたいやね","I got a message from Kiriko too.
It looks like they really are together."
3006004020160,咲耶,"全員集まるのは時間がかかりそうだね……
ちょっと先に始めていようか","Then it'll be a while before everyone is here...
Shall we start ahead of them?"
3006004020170,摩美々,じゃあ準備するからぁ,I'll start preparing then～
3006004020180,摩美々,でー、ココはこんな感じに磨いてー,Then... you polish this part like this...
3006004020190,咲耶,"すごいな……
自分の爪じゃないみたいだ……","Wow...
They don't even look like my own nails..."
3006004020200,恋鐘,"すごかー！
咲耶の爪、どんどんキラキラになっていくばい！","Super neat～! Sakuya's nails just keep gettin'
more and more sparkly!"
3006004020210,摩美々,"磨いてるだけだしー
完成にはまだなんですケドー","This is only the polishing part, you know～?
We still have a lot more to do, so～"
3006004020220,結華,"みんなおはよう、遅くなってごめん！
おっ、さくやんのネイル、どんな感じ？","Morning everyone! Sorry for being late!
Oh, how are your nails going, Sakuyan?"
3006004020230,霧子,みんな……お、お待たせ……,S-Sorry for the wait... Everyone...
3006004020240,恋鐘,"おっはよー！　塗りはまだやけど
咲耶の爪、バリ綺麗かろー？","Mornin'～! The paint ain't on yet, but aren't
Sakuya's nails already super pretty～?"
3006004020250,霧子,……うん……すごくキレイ……！,...Yep... Really pretty...!
3006004020260,結華,"ずっと見てたかったんだけどさ、ごめん、
三峰たちちょっと打ち合わせしなきゃいけなくなって","I wish we could keep watching, but... Sorry!
Both of us have a bit of preparing to do at the
moment..."
3006004020270,結華,"そっちの方、陣取っててもいい？
みんなの邪魔はしないから！","Is it fine if we sit over there?
We'll make sure to stay out of the way!"
3006004020280,霧子,"……遅れてきたのに……ごめんなさい……
急なお仕事が決まったみたいで……","...We're really sorry... For arriving late...
Our work suddenly came out of nowhere..."
3006004020290,恋鐘,"あらら～。結華も霧子も大変やね！
机使ってもいいけん、きばりんば！","My, my～ Both of you have it hard, huh!
Feel free to use the table. Do ya' best!"
3006004020300,結華,"ありがと！
さくやんのネイルの出来栄え、楽しみにしてるね！","Thanks! I'm looking forward to how Sakuyan's
nails will turn out!"
3006004020310,咲耶,"悪いね結華、霧子……
なんだかこちらばかり楽しんでしまって……","I apologize, Yuika, Kiriko...
I ended up being the only one having fun here..."
3006004020320,結華,"ええー？　もともとそれが目的なんだから
さくやん悪くないでしょ","Ehh～? That was our main objective from the
start, so you don't have to feel bad about it,
Sakuyan!"
3006004020330,結華,"こっちこそ中断させちゃってごめんって感じだよ
……じゃあきりりん、奥行こ奥","On the contrary, I kinda feel bad for interrupting!
...Well then, let's just sit over there, Kiririn."
3006004020340,霧子,うん……！,Alright...!
3006004020350,摩美々,"三峰も霧子も大変だねー……
でもまぁ、こっちは気にせず、続きするよー","You two are sure working hard, huh～
...Anyways, we'll just continue with our own thing
here～"
3006004020360,咲耶,ああ、よろしく頼むよ,"Yep, I'll leave it to you."
3006004020370,恋鐘,摩美々は器用やねー,"Mamimi is super skillful, ain't she～?"
3006004020380,摩美々,これくらい簡単だしー,"I haven't done anything difficult yet, though～"
3006004020390,恋鐘,"ねえ、次は塗るんやろ？
うちも挑戦してみたかよ！","Hey, the paint is up next, right?
I'd sure love to take a shot at it!"
3006004020400,摩美々,まぁ、いいですケド？,"Well, sure, why not?"
3006004020410,恋鐘,やったー！　咲耶、うち、がんばるけんね！,"Hurray! Imma do my best, Sakuya!"
3006004020420,咲耶,フフ。恋鐘に塗ってもらえるなんて、嬉しいな,"Haha. It makes me happy that you're going out
of your way to help out."
3006004020430,恋鐘,できたっ！,Done!
3006004020440,摩美々,完成ぇ～,All finished～
3006004020450,咲耶,これは、すごいな……,This is amazing......
3006004020460,摩美々,まぁ、大したことないケド,"Well, it actually wasn't that much work."
3006004020470,恋鐘,"むっちゃかわいかー！
お姫様みたいやね！","It's mighty cute!
You're lookin' just like a princess!"
3006004020480,咲耶,"可愛すぎて、少し照れてしまうな……
だが、とてもいいよ。摩美々、恋鐘、本当にありがとう","It's so cute, it's actually a bit embarrassing...
It's quite amazing, though. Mamimi and Kogane,
thanks so much."
3006004020490,恋鐘,"えへへ！　うちはちょっぴり塗っただけやんね！
でも、咲耶が喜んでくれて嬉しかー！","Ehehe! All I did was put the paint on, though!
But I'm glad that makes ya happy～!"
3006004020500,摩美々,"可愛すぎるって言われても
咲耶のイメージに合わせたデザインだし―","You say it's too cute, but...
I designed it with your image in mind, you know～"
3006004020510,咲耶,"そうか……
私はこういうのも似合うと思われていたのか","I see...
So you think this style matches me, huh..."
3006004020520,咲耶,……フフ,......Hehe.
3006004020530,恋鐘,はぁ……,Haah...
3006004020540,咲耶,ん……どうかしたのかい？,Hm...? Is something wrong?
3006004020550,恋鐘,いや～……今の咲耶、ばりかわいかったけん……,"Noothiing～... I just thought that you were
mighty cute just now...."
3006004020560,咲耶,"そ、そうかな……
なんだか照れてしまうよ……","R-Really...?
That makes me feel embarrassed..."
3006004020570,結華,どうどう？　さくやんのネイルも完成した？,"Well, well? Are Sakuya's nails finished?"
3006004020580,咲耶,結華。打ち合わせは済んだのかい？,Yuika. Did you finish with your preparations?
3006004020590,結華,"もっちろん！　三峰たちにかかれば朝飯前ですよ
ねっ、きりりん！","Of course! Anything is a piece of cake if we put
our minds to it! Right, Kiririn?"
3006004020600,霧子,"うん……決めてほしいって言われてたことは、
ちゃんとまとまったから……","Yep... We had to decide on some things,
and wanted to do it properly..."
3006004020610,結華,"で？　そっちの仕上がりはどんな感じなの──
ってわぁお、姫系ですねぇ、さくやん新境地じゃん！","So! How's it going on this side──
Woah! Super princess-y! Exploring new horizons
are we, Sakuyan!?"
3006004020620,霧子,うん……すごく、素敵……！,Yep... It's really pretty...!
3006004020630,咲耶,"フフ。ありがとう
私もとても気に入っているんだ","Hehe. Thanks.
I really like how they turned out too."
3006004020640,恋鐘,そいじゃあ、みんな揃ったし女子会始めようと？,"Well then, since everyone's here, let's have
an all-girls get together!"
3006004020650,霧子,"あの……
これ……遅れてきたお詫びというか……","Um...
We brought this... To apologize for being late..."
3006004020660,恋鐘,"わっお菓子たい！
お菓子パーティができるけんねー！","Wow, snacks!
Now we can even have a snack party!"
3006004020670,咲耶,フフ、それは素敵だね,"Haha, that's wonderful!"
3006004020680,咲耶,（……私、そんなに嬉しそうだったかな）,"(...I wonder, did I really look that happy?)"
3006004020690,咲耶,"（でも……見れば見るほどかわいいな。光の当たる角度が
違うだけで、雰囲気が変わって見えて……）","(But, yeah... It really is cute, the more I look at it.
And different angles make them reflect the light
differently...)"
3006004020700,咲耶,"（お姫様みたい、か。そんなことを言われるなんて……
フフ。案外悪くないな）","(Like a princess, huh? Describing it like that...
Fufu. I'm surprisingly into it.)"
3006004020710,摩美々,"……そんなじっと見つめてー
ネイル、気に入ったー？","......You've been staring at it for a while～
Does that mean you really do like it～?"
3006004020720,咲耶,ああ。慣れないことでもやってみるものだね,"Yeah. It's something I'm not used to, but I'm glad
I tried it out."
3006004020730,摩美々,"そっかぁ。まぁ、私もそこそこ楽しかったしー
気が向いたらまたしたげるよー","I see. Well, I kinda had fun too～
If you ever feel like it, I can do your nails again～"
3006004020740,咲耶,"そのときは頼むよ
楽しみにしてる","Well then, I'll leave it to you next time.
I'll be looking forward to it."
